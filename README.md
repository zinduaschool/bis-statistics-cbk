# bis-statistics-cbk
This project is part of the 30-day Zindua School SQL-Power BI Challenge

# About BIS statistics
BIS statistics, compiled in cooperation with central banks and other national authorities, are designed to inform analysis of financial stability, international monetary spillovers and global liquidity.

# Data Source 
Source the file from the [BIS](https://data.bis.org/) portal and download raw data from the BIS and save it in a local compute 

# Explore the following statistics, after linking the relevant data: 
1. Choose countries or regions of interest and develop a sliceable data visualization of :
2. Credit to the Private Non-Financial Sector over time
3. Claims on Kenya/Japan (for example) by currency
4. Credits to the non-financial sector bi-furcated by nationals and housholds
5. Debt Service Ratio bi-furcated by nationals and housholds
6. USD Exchange rates over time in countries of interest

> NB: The above are merely suggestions to the relationships and information you can explore. The list is not exhaustive.

 ## Deliverables 
The following are the outcomes expected from the project: 
1. Create a logical and physical SQL Schema - Have it separate and upload it to your GitHub repo
2. Create the the Databases and the tables to contain the data - millitary, age, year - Have it separate and upload it to your GitHub repo
3. Load the data to Power BI and Perform transformations - e.g cleaning the age column, formatting datatypes 
4. Develop Power BI Visualizations 
5. Develop a Power BI - Dashboard 
6. Presentation with Insights.
